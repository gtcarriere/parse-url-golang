#  parse-url-golang

#### A simple URL parser written in Go.

**Note:**
This is still a work in progress. If it crashes, breaks your computer, or just plain doesn't work, I am not responsible for any damage that may occur.

###### Usage:

Clone the repo with git, or otherwise obtain a copy of all the code in this repo.

Run the URL parser with:

```golang
go run parse-url.go
```



~~If you want to try running it without downloading it or if you don't have the Golang compiler on your computer, then you can try~~ ~~it online at the [Golang playground](https://play.golang.org/ "Golang Playground")~~

~~Just open up parse-url.go and copy it to your clipboard, and paste it in the Golang playground.~~

###### Update:

This is not currently working, as the program obtains user input from `stdin` which the Golang playground does not currently support.
